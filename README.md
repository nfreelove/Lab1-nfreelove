Nick Freelove

I am a statistics major with a minor in mathematics and data science
In the past month, I have been getting used to my new class schedule, doing all of my classwork, and attending all of my new classes.
For organizing my work I usually keep track of all of the due dates that I have for my work, I keep everything organized in folders, and I try and plan out when I will do all of my work so that it is done on time.

I am a statistics major, and statistics is a field that is on a steep rise in demand.
In the past month, I have been making food at work, attending classes, and doing homework.
The three most important strategies for organizing work are keeping a planner or calendar, creating a "to do" list, and having specific areas for work and supplies.
